## Task Board Goal
This project's goal was to create a modal with a form in it that would allow the user to make tasks and save them to a task board. The tasks would change colors based on it's due date.  The tasks would also be draggable and droppable into three different columns. I started by making a modal using bootstrap. I added a form with a title text field, a desscription text field and linked a calender to the due date section. I then added the the functions to save and read the task cards in my local storage. When saving the task card I had to make sure that it would create html elements and append those to the proper elements in the html. I also used dayjs to label each new task and added a delete button to each new task. My next function I coded was to render the task list and make each card rendered draggable. Then I coded a function to handle adding new tasks. I finished the web application by making functions to delete and drop the tasks.
